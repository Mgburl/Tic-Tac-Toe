As The Name Says, 

This Is Tic-Tac-Toe With 2 Gamemodes Single Player With Varying Difficulties
& Two Players (Not Online).

I'm Currently Learning IOS Development & Coding As A Whole. I Coded The Main Game Mechanics
By Following:

"Sean Allen's SwiftUI Tic Tac Toe | Portfolio Projects"

This Tutorial Taught Me How To Create The Game Board With A LazyVGrid And Keep Track Of The


Both The Player's & Computer's Current Moves In An Array Which Allowed Me To Input All

The Possible Win Conditons Into Another Array Which Then Can Be Compared

To See If Any Of The Conditions Are Met

Based On The Current Index On The Board...

You Can See The Winning Combinations Are

[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]

Once I Understood The General Idea, I Was Able To Expand The App By Adding

A Two Player Mode That Is Simply Turn Based and Displays Whether It Is X or O's Turn.

This Was Achieved By Creating An Enum With A Case For Player 1(p1) & Player 2(p2)

Along With A Struct In Order To Determine Who's Turn It Is ( X or O ) 

Pop-up Alerts & Vibrations Were Also Used On The Users Device To Notify

When Draw Or Win Conditions Are Met.

I Also Created A Clean User Interface For The Game Including A Home Button, Reset Button, 

& A Main Menu To Navigate The Different Gamemodes.

This Is Also My First App To Be Published To The App Store...

<h1>Future Improvements</h1>

Would Like To Implement An Online Gamemode Possibly Using GameKit
